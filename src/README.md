Model Training: included 2 models for training, one is the VGG19 model, another one is DINO V2 model. The specifications for running the model files are listed below.

VGG19.ipynb
- Environment: Google Colab
- Hosted runtime connection: T4 GPU / A100
- Import files: Please first upload the “COMP90086_2024_Project_train” and “COMP90086_2024_Project_test” folders to google drive (in MyDrive) in order to run the codes.
- Final export of prediction CSV file: The file will be saved in '/content/drive/MyDrive/COMP90086_2024_Project_test/test_predict_VGG.csv'.
