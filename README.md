# Physical Reasoning Prediction Model - Computer Vision

Model Training: included 2 models for training, one is the VGG19 model, another will be the Vision Transformer DINO V2. The specifications for running the model files are listed below.

Model_Training_VGG.ipynb
- Purpose: running VGG19 model
- Environment: Google Colab
- Hosted runtime connection: T4 GPU
- Import files: Please first upload the “COMP90086_2024_Project_train” and “COMP90086_2024_Project_test” folders to google drive in order to run the codes.
- Final export of prediction CSV file: This file should be found at the left sidebar of google colab after runtime. It will be located under the “files” icon, naming “test_predict_VGG_3.csv”.
